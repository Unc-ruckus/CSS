            <p>The Bone
                Nicknamed “The Bone,” the B-1B Lancer is a long-range, multi-mission, supersonic conventional bomber,
                which
                has served the United States Air Force since 1985. The aircraft is on track to continue flying, at
                current
                demanding operations tempo, out to 2040 and beyond, and Boeing partners with the Air Force to keep the
                B-1
                mission ready. Originally designed for nuclear capabilities, the B-1 switched to an exclusively
                conventional
                combat role in the mid-1990s. In 1999, during Operation Allied Force, six B-1s flew 2 percent of the
                strike
                missions, yet dropped 20 percent of the ordnance, and during Operation Enduring Freedom the B-1 flew on
                2
                percent of the sorties while dropping over 40 percent of the precision weapons.</p>
